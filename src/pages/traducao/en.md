Waking up at the calm of “Lagoa de Óbidos (Foz do Arelho)” is an

event impossible to describe in words.

While having a good breakfast, the ducks’ morning visit, in front

of the sailing school, can be observed.

The mild temperature, which Europe's largest saltwater lagoon

provides, generating a “microclimate”, inviting you to take a

walk, either on foot or by bike, knowing that on your return you

will have, a welcoming heated swimming pool waiting for you.

You will still enjoy a dynamic view, like a painting that is

gradually being redrawn before your eyes, with a whole range of

color shades, like small fishing and sailing boats, kitesurfs,

paddling boards, and a sun embracing the immensity of the lagoon

with birds landing there, most of them protected species. You will

quickly forget any audiovisual activity.

At the end of the day, this place still has a small treasure for

you … you will watch and enjoy the most beautiful sunsets of

Portuguese West Coast.
